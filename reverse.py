# Reversing a list using the reversed method
# The output is mostly in a straightforward way going down
# creating a list of integers
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
# print(list(reversed(list1)))- For the list to appear as a list
# using a for loop 
# for new in reversed(list):
#  print(new(list))
print(list(reversed(list1)))
